It works by utilizing a guide RNA (gRNA) that is designed to match a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The Cas9 enzyme, an endonuclease, binds to this guide RNA and is directed to the complementary DNA target. Once bound, Cas9 creates a double-strand break at the specific location. The cell's natural repair mechanisms then respond to this break: through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which can introduce insertions or deletions that disrupt gene function, or through homology-directed repair (HDR), which can incorporate a provided DNA template to make precise changes. This process enables targeted gene modification for research, therapeutic, and biotechnological applications.", "gpt35": "CRISPR-Cas9 works by using a guide RNA molecule to target a specific DNA sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme then cuts the DNA at that location.

When introduced into a cell, the gRNA leads the Cas9 enzyme to the targeted DNA segment.\n\nOnce the gRNA-Cas9 complex locates the matching DNA sequence, the Cas9 enzyme creates a double-strand break at that precise location. This break triggers the cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms, which can be manipulated in two primary ways:\n\n1. Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ): The cell attempts to repair the break directly, which can introduce small insertions or deletions that may disrupt gene function.\n\n2. Homology Directed Repair (HDR): A donor DNA template is provided, allowing scientists to insert specific genetic modifications at the break site.\n\nBy controlling these repair mechanisms, researchers can delete, modify, or replace specific genes with high precision.

Only output the explanation \u2014 do not include any explanation or extra text.", "gpt4nano": "A SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) is a variation at a single position in a DNA sequence among individuals. It can affect phenotype by altering gene function or regulation, potentially changing protein structure or expression levels, which may influence physical traits, disease susceptibility, or responses to environmental factors.", "gpt35": "A SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) is a variation in a single nucleotide that occurs at a specific position in the genome. SNPs can affect phenotype by altering the function of proteins, changing gene expression, or affecting the regulation of gene activity.", "claude": "A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is a genetic variation where a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) is changed at a specific position in the genome. SNPs can affect phenotype by:\n\n1. Altering protein structure or function\n2. Changing gene expression levels\n3. Affecting protein-protein interactions\n4. Modifying enzyme activity\n5. Impacting gene regulation\n6. Potentially causing disease susceptibility\n7. Influencing drug response\n8. Contributing to individual genetic differences\n\nThese variations can result in amino acid changes, premature stop codons, or regulatory region modifications that ultimately impact an organism's observable characteristics or disease risk."}]
